# Python Knowledge Base

This section provides detailed documentation, guides, tutorials, and troubleshooting tips for Python. It aims to help users understand and effectively use Python in their projects.

## Documentation

- [Python Official Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/): The official Python documentation provides comprehensive information about the Python language, its standard library, and various modules.

## Guides

### Getting Started with Python

1. **Install Python**: Download and install Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. **Write Your First Python Program**: Create a new file with a `.py` extension and write the following code:
   ```python
   print("Hello, World!")
   ```
3. **Run Your Python Program**: Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where your Python file is located, and run the following command:
   ```sh
   python your_file_name.py
   ```

### Virtual Environments

Virtual environments allow you to create isolated Python environments for your projects, ensuring that dependencies are managed separately.

1. **Create a Virtual Environment**: Run the following command to create a virtual environment:
   ```sh
   python -m venv myenv
   ```
2. **Activate the Virtual Environment**:
   - On Windows:
     ```sh
     myenv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS and Linux:
     ```sh
     source myenv/bin/activate
     ```
3. **Install Packages**: Use `pip` to install packages within the virtual environment:
   ```sh
   pip install package_name
   ```
4. **Deactivate the Virtual Environment**: Run the following command to deactivate the virtual environment:
   ```sh
   deactivate
   ```
