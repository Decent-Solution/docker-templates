This section provides detailed documentation, guides, tutorials, and troubleshooting tips for MLflow. It aims to help users understand and effectively use MLflow in their projects.

## Documentation

- [MLflow Official Documentation](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/index.html): The official MLflow documentation provides comprehensive information about MLflow, its features, and various modules.

## Guides

### Getting Started with MLflow

1. **Install MLflow**: Install MLflow using pip:
   ```sh
   pip install mlflow
   ```
2. **Run MLflow Tracking Server**: Run the following command to start the MLflow Tracking Server:
   ```sh
   mlflow server --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5000
   ```
3. **Log Experiments**: Use the MLflow Python API to log experiments:
   ```python
   import mlflow

   with mlflow.start_run():
       mlflow.log_param("param1", 5)
       mlflow.log_metric("metric1", 0.89)
   ```

### MLflow Projects

MLflow Projects is a way to package data science code in a reusable and reproducible format.

1. **Create an MLproject File**: Create a file named `MLproject` in your project directory with the following content:
   ```yaml
   name: my_project

   entry_points:
     main:
       parameters:
         param1: {type: int, default: 5}
       command: "python train.py --param1 {param1}"
   ```
2. **Run the Project**: Run the following command to execute the project:
   ```sh
   mlflow run . -P param1=10
   ```
