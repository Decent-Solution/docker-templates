# Docker Compose Templates

This directory contains Docker Compose templates and custom stacks that are categorized, indexed, tagged, and structured to serve as both a library and catalog. These templates and tools are designed to facilitate user deployment and showcase Decent Solutions' capabilities.

## Structure

- Each subdirectory contains a specific Docker Compose template or custom stack.
- Each subdirectory includes a `docker-compose.yml` file and a `README.md` file.
- The `README.md` file provides an explanation of the purpose and usage of the template or stack, along with guides and knowledge base content related to the container(s) in the stack.

## Index

The `index.json` file categorizes and tags the templates and custom stacks for easy reference.

## Example

For example, if we have a Python, Jupyter, and ML stack, the corresponding subdirectory will contain the necessary Docker Compose file and documentation to educate and facilitate user deployment.
